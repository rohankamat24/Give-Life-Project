The Project isn't system agnostic, It will only work on my system.

It will require javafx-sdk-21.0.6 in the path as `/javafx/javafx-sdk-21.0.6` at the root of project. 

Maybe Work on making it system agnostic Download javafx in the run.sh file if it is not already present.

No plans on mayning a windows version yet. But I might need to.
